# Scene View
Letâ€™s quickly review the basics:
- Pan: Select the Hand tool in the Toolbar, and click and drag in the Scene view to move your view.
- Zoom: Holding Alt (Windows) or Option (macOS), right-click and drag in the Scene view to zoom.
- Orbit: Holding Alt (Windows) or Option (macOS),  left-click and drag to orbit around the current pivot point. Note: this option is not available in 2D mode.
- Focus (Frame Select): When a GameObject is selected, select F with your cursor in the Scene view to focus your view on that GameObject. Note: If your cursor is not in the Scene view, Frame Select will not work.

Flythrough mode

You can also use Flythrough mode to navigate in the Scene view by flying around in first person, which is common in many games. To do this:
- Click and hold the right mouse button.
- Use WASD to move the view left/right/forward/backward.
- Use Q and E to move the view up and down.
- Select and hold Shift to move faster.
